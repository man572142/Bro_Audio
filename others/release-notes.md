# Release Notes

## Ver. 3.1.2 **(**[**Github**](https://github.com/man572142/Bro_Audio/releases/tag/3.1.1)**,** [**Unity Asset Store**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/bro-audio-257362)**)**

#### Upgrading from v2.x.x to v3.x.x

SoundID has been completely rearchitected from an integer-based struct to a direct AudioEntity ScriptableObject reference. That means no more loading every audio asset into memory on startup whether you use it or not. Better runtime performance, better memory usage.

**Breaking Change Notice:** Every SoundID in your project will need to be migrated. But don't worry, a SoundID Upgrader will automatically launch on update and handle the migration for you.\
⚠️Before updating, make sure you have a project backup or everything committed to version control.

**Fixes & Improvements**

* Fix infinite loop in SoundIDUpgrader causing memory exhaustion while searching in the VisualTreeAsset

## Ver. **3.1.1**&#x20;

**Fixes & Improvements**

* Automatically migrates legacy BroAudio folder layout (Core/Scripts) to the new UPM-compatible structure (Editor/ and Runtime/)
* Enhanced SoundIDUpgrader to only search relevant asset types
* Updated all demo scripts to support both legacy Input system and new Input System
* Ensured PlayableDirector.stopped event is properly unsubscribed in OnDestroy()
* Fixed PlaybackGroupEditor cleanup to prevent memory leaks
* Removed automatic default asset output folder creation feature from initialization

## Ver. **3.1.0**

#### ⚠️ Breaking Change — SoundID Architecture Overhaul

Previously, BroAudio loaded every audio asset into memory on startup regardless of whether it was used. In this update, SoundID has been rearchitected from an integer-based struct to a direct AudioEntity ScriptableObject reference, improving both runtime efficiency and memory usage.\
However, this is a non-backwards-compatible change that affects every SoundID in your project. A migration tool (SoundID Upgrader) will automatically launch and guide you through the upgrade process.

🛑 Before updating, please make sure you have:

* A backup of your project, OR
* All changes committed to version control

    Value: 'This action cannot be undone! Please check the following instructions

      2. The process will duplicate the last
      generic track of the BroAudioMixer. Make sure it''s at its original setting.'
  - Key: 13
    Value: Max Real Voices will determine how many sounds can be heard simultaneously
      by Unity's Audio Engine. The track count of BroAudioMixer should be greater

      inaudible until a Real Voice becomes available. BroVirtual tracks ensure that
      the voices returning from Virtual Voices can be controlled again.
